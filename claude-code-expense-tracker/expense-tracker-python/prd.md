I want you to create a modern, professional expense tracking application. Here's my vision:

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:

- View expenses in a clean, organized list
- Filter expenses by date range and category
- Dashboard with spending summaries and basic analytics
- Categories: Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Shopping, Bills, Other
- Data persistence using localStorage for this demo

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use FastAPI with RESTful endpoints
- NiceGUI for frontend
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

- Form validation for expense inputs
- Date picker for expense dates
- Currency formatting for amounts

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, modern interface with a professional color scheme

Please create this as a complete, production-ready application. Set up the project structure, implement all features, and make sure everything works together seamlessly. Focus on creating something that looks professional and that I could actually use to track my expenses.

When you're done, provide instructions on how to run the application and test all features.
